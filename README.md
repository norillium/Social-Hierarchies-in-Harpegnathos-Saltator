This is a lab report for the R analysis I did in a biology lab at Arizona State University. 
There are two files- one is a lab report regarding an analysis of social dominance behavior in Harpegnathos Saltator, a type of ant. 
The other document is an analysis of a computer vision model created by European collaborators.
Feel free to read through! The code is in a dropbox I don't have access to, and the data is private unfortunately.
